# Graph-Traversal-Visualization
This code demonstrates graph traversal  Visualization algorithms using both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

# Overview
I have developed a web page utilizing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to visualize graph traversal algorithms, specifically Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

# How it works
1) Create the graph:
  * You enter your vertices,on clicking create graph button,it forms the graph.
2) Form Connections:
  * You select your source vertex and destination vertex to create a complete graph.
3) Start Traversal
  * Click "Start BFS" or "Start DFS" to initiate the traversal.The algorithm will run and visualize the traversal process in real-time.

# Features
* Interactive Input: Easily input vertices and create connections between them.
* Real-time Visualization: Watch the BFS and DFS algorithms traverse the graph step-by-step.
* User-friendly Interface: Intuitive and responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
